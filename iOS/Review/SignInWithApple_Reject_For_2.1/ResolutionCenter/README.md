- `2`. 1 Performance: App Completeness

### Guideline 2.1-Performance-App Completeness

We discovered one or more bugs in your app. Specifically, login with Sign in with Apple loaded with error as displayed. Please review the details below and complete the next steps.

Review device details:

- Device type: iPhone and iPad
- OS version: iOS 15.0.2

**Next Steps :**

Please run your app on a device to reproduce the issues, then revise and submit your app for review. If at first you're unable to reproduce the issue, try the following:

- For new apps, uninstall all previous versions of your app from a device, then install and follow the steps to reproduce.
- For app updates, install the new version as an update to the previous version, then follow the steps to reproduce.

If we misunderstood the intended behavior of your app, please reply to this message in Resolution Center to provide information on how these features were intended to work.

- For information about testing apps and preparing them for review, see [Technical Note TN2431: App Testing Guide].

### Guideline 2.1-Information Needed

We have started your app's review, but we were unable to successfully access all or part of your app.

In order for us to continue the review, we need to have a way to verify all app features and functionality. Typically this is done by providing a demo account that has access to all features and functionality in your app. It is also acceptable to include a demonstration mode that exhibits your app’s full features and functionality. Note that providing a demo video showing your app in use is not enough for us to continue the review.

**Next Steps :**

To help us proceed with the review of your app, please provide a user name and password in the App Review Information section of App Store Connect. Please be sure that the demo account includes content that demonstrates the features and functionality available in your app.

To provide demo account information:

- Log in to App Store Connect
- Click "My Apps"
- Select your app
- Click on the app version on the left side of the screen
- Scroll down to "App Review Information"
- Select the "Sign-in required" box
- Enter demo credentials in the "User name" and "Password" fields
- Once you've completed all changes, click the "Save" button at the top of the Version Information page

Please see attached screenshot for details.
